# Travel Book - Your Digital Travel Journal

## Project Overview

Travel Book is a modern web application designed to help users document, organize, and share their travel experiences. It serves as a digital travel journal where users can record memories, photos, and details about places they've visited. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for travelers to create a personal collection of travel stories, organize them by location and date, and optionally share them with others.

## Purpose & Vision

- Providing an intuitive way to document travel experiences
